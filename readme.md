# PowerShell Terminal #

This project is my humble attempt at creating a web-based powershell terminal.  It is built with node.js and uses the node-powershell module as the powershell backend.

Creating a web-based powershell terminal enables you to remotely run powershell through your web browser.  While this introduces tons of security concerns, I think it is a powerful concept that is worth considering.

My implementation is very basic, there is no security, so I would only run it locally.
